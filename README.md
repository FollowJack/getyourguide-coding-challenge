# Get Your Guide Challenge 
Purpose of this app is to have a searchable list of tours. 

The user sees a compact list of tours.
Users can:
- search for a title. If not found then other tours are suggested (mocked).
- bookmark easily their favorite tours (mocked).
- see special offers in form of a sale - emphasized with colors and banner

In general:
 - Thanks to styled components the overall design is themed and fully customizable during runtime. See: ```src/constants.js```
